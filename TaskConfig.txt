Summary: Verified that ai-persona.html already contains the necessary HTML structure (dropdown with 20 personas) and JavaScript logic (persona prompts, welcome messages, Gemini API call function using streaming and correct model/key) to implement the 20 persona agents as requested. No code changes were needed as the integration was pre-existing in the file.
